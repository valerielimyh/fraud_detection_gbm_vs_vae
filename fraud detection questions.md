# Fraud Detection
 
The objective of a fraud detection algorithm is to detect anomalous transactions from normal customer behaviour or specific behaviours tagged as fraudulent. This repo compares 2 types of fraud detection algorithms - gradient boosting models vs. variational autoencoeder (VAE). Detailed explanation on VAE is found in `notebooks/03_fraud_detection_vae.ipynb`. 

## Data
All fields outside of the timestamp amt and clss fields are outputs from a dimensionality reduction.
